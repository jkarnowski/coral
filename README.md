DBC hackathon web app for teacher feedback cycle

##What is coral? 
coral is a web app that allows teachers to drive their own development. Deepen your understanding of best teaching practices by observing others teach. Practice giving kind, specific, actionable feedback and engage with other teachers to perfect your craft. 

##Why? 
- As a former teacher and early career teacher coach, I saw a trend. Teachers do not get the feedback they need to continue implementing great teaching strategies and habits or conversely, the feedback they need in order to improve their effectiveness. Over and over again, I have heard a colleague say they were observed 2 times - or 0! - in a year. The impact on student achievement is direct and not acceptable. Imagine if a doctor didn't receive feedback on an error during heart surgery. Yikes. An effective pilot can land a plane smoothly because someone provided feedback on the techniques to make that happen.
